Step 1: Virtual environment creation and installation of required python libraries

1. Creating python virtual environment with conda.

1. conda create -p <name_of_virtual_environement> python==<python_version_like-3.10>
2. conda init - if conda is not initialised  in current working directory.
3. restart the terminal if required - once terminal is initialised with conda you'll see (base) at the start in your terminal.
4. conda activate <name_of_virtual_environement>. - successful activation will lead to change in (base) environment.

2. indtalling all the required librariries in the chosen environment

run -> pip install -r requirements.txt
